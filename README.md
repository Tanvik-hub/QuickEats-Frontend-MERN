# QuickEats - Multi-Vendor Food App using MERN

QuickEats is a multi-vendor food application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This project allows vendors who own hotels, restaurants, or other food-related establishments to register, log in, and manage their businesses through a dedicated vendor dashboard. The businesses added by vendors are then displayed on the frontend of the QuickEats app for users to explore and order from.

## Features

- **Vendor Registration and Login:** Vendors can create an account, securely log in, and manage their business details.
- **Vendor Dashboard:** A user-friendly backend interface for vendors to add, update, and manage their hotels, restaurants, or other food-related establishments. Vendors can:
  - Add new businesses with details such as name, location, cuisine type, and more.
  - Upload images to showcase their offerings.
  - Manage menu items, including adding, updating, and removing dishes.
  - Set special offers or discounts.
- **Frontend Display:** A sleek and responsive frontend where customers can:
  - Browse through the list of registered vendors.
  - View detailed information about each vendor, including their menu, location, and ratings.
  - Place orders directly through the platform.
- **Search and Filter:** Users can search for specific vendors or dishes and filter results based on criteria like cuisine type, location, and price range.
- **Order Management:** Users can track their order status, and vendors can manage incoming orders in real-time.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.


## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, Redux (for state management), React Router (for navigation), CSS3, Bootstrap (for styling)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB (for storing vendor, menu, and order data)
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure authentication
- **Deployment:** 
  - **Frontend:** Vercel 
  - **Backend:** Render.com 
  - **Database:** MongoDB Atlas
- **APIs:** Custom RESTful APIs built with Express.js to handle all CRUD operations for vendors, menu items, and orders.

## Project Overview

This project took approximately three months to complete. During this time, I learned and implemented the full MERN stack to create a robust and scalable application. The vendor dashboard serves as the backend for the QuickEats app, enabling vendors to seamlessly add their businesses to the platform. The frontend showcases these businesses, providing users with an intuitive interface to browse and order food.
